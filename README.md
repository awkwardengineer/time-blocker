# Time Blocker

A task planning application designed for users who prefer physical paper but need to integrate with their digital calendar. The app centers around a WYSIWYG printout of a standard 8.5x11" (US) or A4 (Europe) sheet that can be printed for physical use, while also supporting mobile on-the-go usage.

**Target User:** People who love paper but still have digital lives.

**Core Value Proposition:** Bridge the gap between digital calendar integration and physical paper planning, supporting both print-based planning and mobile on-the-go usage.

## Project Structure

This project is organized into numbered directories that reflect the development workflow:

```

└── 5-dist/                     # Build output (deployed to GitHub Pages)
    └── [compiled files]        # Generated by build process
```

**Important:** All development happens in `4-src/`. The `5-dist/` folder contains build output and should not be edited directly.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18 or higher recommended)
- npm

### Development

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd 4-src
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown in terminal)

3. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   npm test              # Run all tests once
   npm run test:watch    # Run tests in watch mode
   npm run test:coverage # Generate coverage report
   npm run test:e2e      # Run end-to-end tests (Playwright)
   ```

### Building for Production

1. **Build the application:**
   ```bash
   cd 4-src
   npm run build
   ```
   This compiles the application and outputs static files to `5-dist/`

2. **Preview the production build:**
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```
   This serves the built files from `5-dist/` at `http://localhost:4173`

### Deployment

The `5-dist/` folder contains the production build and can be deployed to any static hosting service (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.).

**Note:** The build process runs tests automatically before building (`prebuild` script).

## Current Status

**Milestone 020 Complete:** Mock data storage and display
- ✅ Dexie.js database setup with IndexedDB
- ✅ Mock data seeding
- ✅ Data retrieval and display
- ✅ Unit and integration tests

See `3-project-plans/` for detailed milestone information and roadmap.
