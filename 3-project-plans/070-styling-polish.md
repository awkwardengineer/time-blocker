# 070: Styling & Polish

## Goal
Implement visual design, polish empty state appearance, and refine print layout styling. This milestone focuses on making the application visually appealing and ensuring the print output matches the on-screen appearance (WYSIWYG).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Visual design implemented with consistent styling
- [ ] Empty state appearance is polished (both "no lists" and "no tasks" states)
- [ ] Print layout styling matches on-screen appearance (WYSIWYG)
- [ ] Responsive design works across different screen sizes
- [ ] Visual feedback for interactions (hover, focus, active states)
- [ ] Consistent typography and spacing
- [ ] Color scheme and visual hierarchy established
- [ ] Print CSS ensures accurate page layout

## Implementation Steps

1. **Design System Setup**
   - Define color palette
   - Establish typography scale
   - Set spacing system
   - Create consistent component styling

2. **Empty State Styling**
   - Polish "no lists" empty state appearance
   - Polish "no tasks" empty state appearance
   - Add appropriate visual elements (icons, illustrations, or text)
   - Ensure empty states are visually appealing and informative

3. **Component Styling**
   - Style task items (unchecked, checked, archived states)
   - Style list headers and containers
   - Style input fields and buttons
   - Add hover and focus states
   - Ensure consistent visual feedback

4. **Print Layout Styling**
   - Ensure print CSS matches on-screen appearance
   - Handle page breaks appropriately
   - Ensure print layout is readable and functional
   - Test print output across different browsers
   - Verify WYSIWYG accuracy

5. **Responsive Design**
   - Ensure layout works on mobile devices
   - Test on different screen sizes
   - Handle responsive breakpoints
   - Ensure touch targets are appropriately sized

6. **Visual Polish**
   - Add transitions and animations (if appropriate)
   - Ensure consistent spacing throughout
   - Polish visual hierarchy
   - Ensure accessibility (contrast, focus indicators)

7. **Test**
   - **Manual Testing**:
     - Verify visual design is consistent
     - Test empty states appearance
     - Test print output matches on-screen
     - Test responsive behavior
     - Verify visual feedback for interactions
   - **Browser Testing**:
     - Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
     - Verify print output in each browser
     - Test responsive design on different devices

## Quick Notes
- **WYSIWYG**: Print output must match on-screen appearance
- **Empty States**: Both "no lists" and "no tasks" states need visual polish
- **Print CSS**: Ensure accurate page layout and readability
- **Responsive**: Must work on mobile and desktop
- **Accessibility**: Maintain proper contrast and focus indicators
- Requires: All previous milestones (functionality must be complete)
- This milestone focuses on visual design and polish, not new functionality
