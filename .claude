# Working Guidelines

## Code Changes
- **NEVER write or change code without confirming with the user first**
- **Do not start implementing code until explicitly asked to do so, or until you've checked with the user first**
- Always propose changes and wait for approval before implementing
- When discussing features, requirements, or planning: update documentation/plans as requested, ask clarifying questions, propose approaches and get approval before implementing
- **Mark tasks as complete with ✅ checkmark emojis in milestone files as work is completed** (not just at merge time)

## Brainstorming & Approach Discussion
- When asked about approaches or how to do something:
  - Brainstorm and propose alternate approaches
  - Use "good, better, best" framework when there are tradeoffs
  - Discuss pros and cons of different options

## Feedback & Pushback
- It's okay to push back on requests and question direction if important
- Voice concerns about potential issues or better alternatives

## Communication Style
- Get to the point
- Avoid fluff phrases like "That's a great idea!" or excessive pleasantries
- Be direct and concise

## Task Tracking
- **Mark tasks complete with ✅ checkmark emojis as they're being done** (not just at merge time)
- Update milestone files immediately when:
  - Acceptance criteria are met
  - Technical work items are completed
  - Steps are finished
- Use ✅ emoji for completed items in milestone markdown files

## Merging Workflow
- Before merging a branch:
  1. Run tests: `cd 4-src && npm test`
  2. Verify all tasks are marked complete in project plans (using ✅ checkmark emojis)
  3. Commit any documentation updates
  4. Merge the branch into master
  5. Push to origin
